# TicTacToe
A simple tic-tac-toe application created using React. The app has been deployed and is live [here](https://tictactoe.dhruvjain.co)

## Current Features
- Two player functionality
- Disabling the game to avoid changes after someone wins

> **Note**: **React** has not been explicitly installed. **React babel** is used for the project for simplification.

## Contributions
This project is open for contributions to enhance and develop the application further. Feel free to create a pull request if you wish to contribute.
